These projects I created with the aim of learning and exploring new areas of interest.

- ## [EUR/USD Forex Market Prediction: Conv1D Model with MultiHeadAttention for Exchange Rate Forecasting](https://github.com/spoluan/Forex_market_prediction_EUR_USD)
  Forex is a global marketplace where currencies are bought and sold, with a daily trading volume reaching trillions of dollars, making it the largest and most liquid financial market. Forex trading involves speculating on fluctuations in exchange rates between different currency pairs, such as EUR/USD and GBP/JPY. EUR/USD is one of the most actively traded currency pairs, representing the exchange rate between the Euro and the US Dollar. The exchange rate between these currencies is influenced by economic indicators, political events, central bank policies, and market sentiment. Traders and investors analyze historical price data and use technical and fundamental analysis techniques to predict future movements in the EUR/USD exchange rate. In this project, a Conv1D model with a MultiHeadAttention layer is used for predicting the future price of this time series data.

- ## [Federated Learning for MNIST Digits](https://github.com/spoluan/federated_learning_mnistdigit)
  Federated learning is a decentralized machine learning approach that enables training models without requiring data to be centralized in one location. Instead, the learning process takes place on the edge devices or local servers where the data is generated. This collaborative method offers privacy, as the data remains on the devices, and allows for efficient training on a large scale. With federated learning, models are trained across distributed devices, and only the model updates are shared, ensuring privacy and preserving data locality.
